# NFL-running-backs-2019

### This project takes the statistics of the top 50 rushers(in total rush yards) for the 2019 NFL season and creates an interactive visualization dashboard using the Python Framework Dash by Plotly.

### Inspiration for this project came when I watched Derrick Henry's electric performance against the Patriots in the Wild Card Round of the NFL Playoffs and became curious to see his season leading up to his rushing title.
